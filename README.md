# ETH Wallet Analyzer

Your personal AI assistant acting like a casual Telegram user. It can do tasks like any Telegram member such as:
- joining a channel/group
- leaving a channel/group
- sending a message to a user
- commenting on channel posts
- checking if its a member of a channel/group
- showing a conversation history with a user/from a group or channel

It also works with a simple database where it saved the data about the joined groups, channels/groups currently following and their messages.
The bot writes the SQL query on its own, so it can do ANY task related to the database (like dropping the table)!
